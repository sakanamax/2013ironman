# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by Ruby.
# 註解是用來看程式的說明的, 在#符號後面的字元都會被 Ruby 忽略

puts "I could have code like this."# and the comment after is ignored 這段文字會被忽略

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."
# 你也可以使用註解來停用某些程式碼

puts "This will run."
